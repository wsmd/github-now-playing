## Motivation

GitHub recently introduced a [new feature](https://github.blog/changelog/2019-01-09-set-your-status/) that allows users to set a status on their GitHub profile.

I built [`github-profile-status`](https://github.com/wsmd/github-profile-status) as a way to update that status programmatically to do all sort of cool stuff. I wanted to put it into use, and I though it would be a cool idea if I could share the music I'm listening to on my GitHub profile!

It's kind of like #NowPlaying but for GitHub!

## Usage

```ts
import { GitHubNowPlaying, NowPlayingSources } from 'github-now-playing';

const nowPlaying = new GitHubNowPlaying({
  token: process.env.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN,
});

// NowPlayingSources includes iTunes and Spotify as well
nowPlaying.source = new NowPlayingSources.LastFM({
  apiKey: process.env.LASTFM_API_KEY,
  updateFrequency: 1000,
});

// A new track was captured, and the profile status was updated successfully
nowPlaying.on(GitHubNowPlaying.Events.StatusUpdated, track => {
  console.log('status updated', track.title, track.artist);
});

// No tracks were captured, and the profile status was cleared successfully
nowPlaying.on(GitHubNowPlaying.Events.StatusCleared, () => {
  console.log('status cleared');
});

// Something went wrong!
nowPlaying.on(GitHubNowPlaying.Events.Error, error => {
  console.log('something went wrong');
});
```
